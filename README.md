A copy of the game Stick Hero (it is in both the AppStore and PlayMarket).

The following things are implemented:
1. The gameplay itself (tap is vertically growing stick, which then falls horizontally, and there is also a red indicator in the center of the next platform, giving an extra point).
2. Main menu (there is a button for disabling and enabling sounds, as well as a Play button).
3. The game screen (in fact, only the points collected are displayed there). The transition from the start screen to the game itself visually occurs smoothly, as in the original.
4. The game's end-of-game menu (in it current points scored, the best result and restart). The game is restarted NOT with the help of unloading and a new download of the current scene.
5. There are sounds in the game.
