A copy of the game Stick Hero (it is in both the AppStore and PlayMarket).

The following things are implemented:
1. The game process itself (tapes vertically grow a stick, which then falls horizontally;
Also there is a red indicator in the center of the next platform, giving an extra point).
2. In the game there are sounds.
3. Main menu (there is a button for turning the sounds on and off, and also the Play button).
4. The game's end-of-game menu (in it current points scored, the best result and restart). The game is restarted NOT by unloading and loading a new scene.
5. The game screen (in fact, only the points collected are displayed there). The transition from the start screen to the game itself is visually
smoothly, as in the original.
